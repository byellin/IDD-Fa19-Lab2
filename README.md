# Digital Timer
 
Include your responses to the bold questions below. Include snippets of code that explain what you did. Deliverables are due next Tuesday. Post your lab reports as README.md pages on your GitHub, and post a link to that on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Solder your LCD panel

**Take a picture of your soldered panel and add it here!**

## Part B. Writing to the LCD
 
**a. What voltage level do you need to power your display?**

 The voltage needs to be at 80% in order for words to be displayed. 

**b. What voltage level do you need to power the display backlight?**

The display is powered over the entire range of voltages that the potentiometer allows. 

**c. What was one mistake you made when wiring up the display? How did you fix it?**

The first time I soldered the pins on the LED display some of the pins ended up connected to each other. I fixed this by resoldering the pins and making sure that they were separated from each other. 

**d. What line of code do you need to change to make it flash your name instead of "Hello World"?**
 
 The line that we have to change to make it flash my name is "lcd.print("hello, world!");."
 
**e. Include a copy of your Lowly Multimeter code in your lab write-up.**

## Part C. Using a time-based digital sensor

**Upload a video of your working rotary encoder here.**

## Part D. Make your Arduino sing!

**a. How would you change the code to make the song play twice as fast?**

To make the song play twice as fast, I doubled all of the values in noteDurations. 
 
**b. What song is playing?**

Shave and a Haircut Two Bits

## Part E. Make your own timer

**a. Make a short video showing how your timer works, and what happens when time is up!**

**b. Post a link to the completed lab report your class hub GitHub repo.**
